Introduction
============

CircuitPython driver for the Texas Instruments' TMP75 I2C temprature sensor.
`Product page <http://www.ti.com/product/TMP75>`_.

Tested on Raspberry Pi (Debian Stretch) with Adafruit-Blinka and Adafruit-IO
Tested on CircuitPlaygroung Express with CircuitPython 4.0.0-beta6

Dependencies
=============
This driver depends on:

* `Adafruit CircuitPython <https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython>`_
* `Bus Device <https://github.com/adafruit/AdafruitCircuitPythonBusDevice>`_

Please ensure all dependencies are available on the CircuitPython filesystem.
This is easily achieved by downloading
`the Adafruit library and driver bundle <https://github.com/adafruit/AdafruitCircuitPythonBundle>`_.

Usage Example
=============

- Simple example : `tmp75_simpletest.py <https://github.com/barbudor/CircuitPython_TMP75/blob/master/examples/tmp75_simpletest.py>`_.
- Adafruit IO example : `tmp75_adafruitio.py <https://github.com/barbudor/CircuitPython_TMP75/blob/master/examples/tmp75_adafruitio.py>`_.


Contributing
============

Contributions welcomed. My goal is to keep the library simple and as low on memory as possible.
