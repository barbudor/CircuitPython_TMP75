CircuitPython driver library for Texas Instruments' TMP75 I2C temperature sensor


Dependencies
=============
This driver depends on:

* `Adafruit CircuitPython <https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython>`_
* `Bus Device <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BusDevice>`_

Please ensure all dependencies are available on the CircuitPython filesystem.
This is easily achieved by downloading
`the Adafruit library and driver bundle <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle>`_.

Installing from PyPI
--------------------
.. note:: This library is not available on PyPI yet.

Usage Example
=============

see `example <https://github.com/barbudor/CircuitPython_TMP75/blob/master/examples/tmp75_simpletest.py>`_.

Contributing
============

Contributions welcomed. My goal is to keep the library simple and as low on memory as possible.
